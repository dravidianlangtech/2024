							The development of technology increases our internet use, and most of the global languages have adapted themselves 
							to the digital era. However, there are many regional, under-resourced languages that face challenges as they still
							lack developments in language technology [1]. One such language family is the Dravidian family of languages.
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages">Dravidian
							languages</a> are primarily spoken in south India and Sri Lanka. Pockets of
							speakers are found in Nepal, Pakistan, Malaysia, other parts of India and elsewhere in
							the world. The Dravidian languages, which are 4,500 years old [2] and spoken by millions of speakers,
							are under-resourced in speech and natural language processing [1]. </p>
						<p>The Dravidian languages are divided into four
							groups: South, South-Central, Central, and North groups.
							Dravidian morphology is agglutinating and exclusively suffixal.
							Syntactically, Dravidian languages are head-final and
							left-branching. They are free-constituent order languages. To
							improve access to and production of information for monolingual
							speakers of Dravidian languages, it is necessary to have speech
							and languages technologies. The aim of these workshops is to save
							the Dravidian languages from extinction in technology. This is
							the first workshop on speech and language technologies for
							Dravidian languages.&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p>The broader objective of DravidianLangTech-2024 will be</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To investigate challenges related to speech and language
								resource creation for Dravidian languages.</li>
							<li>To promote a research in speech and language technology
								in Dravidian languages.</li>
							<li>To adopt appropriate language technology models which
								suit Dravidian languages</li>
							<li>To provide opportunities for researchers from the
								Dravidian language community from around the world to
								collaborate with other researchers.</li>
						</ul>
